## About The Project

This Python code is a fun geography game where you try to guess all 50 states of the USA. You'll see a map outline of the US and need to type in the name of a state. If your guess is correct, the state name will be displayed on the map. The game ends when you either guess all 50 states or choose to exit.

## Built With

Python
Turtle
